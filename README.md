# Probability-Map-Generator-SAR-
Codes written to aid finding missing person in Search and Rescue Scenarios. The program takes x,y,z inputs from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data plotted in ArcGis Pro and retrieved for processing in MATLAB. The program produces a probability map of likely locations a missing person may be found in wilderness SAR based upon elevation, subject category (ie. hiker, child etc.) and distance. This probability map output format is chosen such that a travelling salesman path planning algorithm may be applied, and the subsequent path uploaded to the CPU and autopilot of a UAV, such that a UAV may automatedly conduct the search pattern.
